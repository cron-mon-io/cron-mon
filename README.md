CronMon is a tool for monitoring cronjobs (or _tasks_ of a similar nature), written in Rust. It was
created for two reasons:

1. Curiosity as to whether or not Rust was a good choice of language for building web services and
   APIs, and how well Domain Driven Design could be applied in that context.
2. A need to monitor numerous cronjobs, but nothing to justify spending money on one of the
   pre-existing soloutions.

Further to the second point, note that there isn't anything novel about CronMon; there are plenty of
existing solutions in this space already, such as
[Cronitor.io](https://cronitor.io/cron-job-monitoring), [Healthchecks.io](https://healthchecks.io),
[Cronhub.io](https://cronhub.io), and
[Sentryâ€™s Cron Monitoring](https://sentry.io/for/cron-monitoring/), to name but a few.

## Current status

CronMon is currently still under development, but it does support basic usage.

## Basic design

CronMon is designed around _Monitors_ and _Jobs_. A Monitor is responsible for monitoring the
execution of a specific cronjob or task and reporting any issues or failures, and _contains_ Jobs,
which are a record of a single execution of the cronjob or task being monitored.

CronMon is comprised of two key components; a RESTful API for creating and managing Monitors, and
recording their Jobs; and a microservice that detects when jobs are late and notifies the owner of
the Monitor.

> Note that CronMon currently doesn't have the ability to notify when Jobs are late, but this is
> coming soon.

There is also a frontend application for CronMon, which you'll find at
https://github.com/cron-mon-io/cron-mon-app.

## Getting started

All you need to setup a development environment for CronMon is Docker and your IDE of choice. A
`Makefile` is provided to make _driving_ the project quick and simple. The easiest way to get setup
is to simply clone the project and then run `make install` from the root of the project to build the
containers. From here you can run the projects (unit) tests by running `make test`, and you can run
the API application via `make run`, after which the API will be available to you locally at
`http://127.0.0.1:8000`, which you'll be able to confirm by hitting
[the healthcheck endpoint](http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/health).

You'll probably want to also run `make run-monitor` in a separate terminal/ tab to run the
background service that monitors for late jobs (this is purely to avoid cluttering the same
terminal/ tab with logs from the API **and** the background serice). When this is running you should
see something similar to this in the terminal its running in.

A [Development container](https://containers.dev/) configuration file is also provided to ensure
your IDE can use your local containers' environments and to provide a pre-setup, consistent and
reliable debug configuration (this is tried and tested on Visual Studio Code).

### Makefile

- `install`: Builds all application containers, installs the required Node modules in the Vue
  application and sets up a local PostgreSQL database with test data.
- `build-containers`: Builds all application containers.
- `run`: Run the CronMon API (release build).
- `run-debug` Run a debug build of the CronMon API.
- `run-monitor`: Run the CronMon monitoring service (release build).
- `run-monitor-debug`: Run a debug build of the CronMon monitoring service.
- `test`: Run all units tests.
- `integration-tests`: Run the **integration** tests (note that this will remove whatever's in your
  local database, and as such these tests will never run unless they're invoked via this command).
- `migration`: Create a new database migration. Note that this command requires a `name` parameter,
  which be used as the name for the migration. After the migration has been created you'll need to
  write the actual migration scripts within the generated `up.sql` and `down.sql` files in the
  generated migration.
- `migrate`: Run any migrations that haven't been applied to the local database.
- `migrate-redo`: Downgrade and then re apply the latest migration on the local database.
- `seed`: Remove all data from the local database and insert the test data (this is the same test
  data that get's written to the local database during `make install`).
- `delete-postgres-volume`: Remove the Docker volume being used to make PostgreSQL data persist.
  This can be handy is you run into any problems with your local database and you just want to trash
  it and start again. The next time the database container runs this will be recreated naturally

## Deployment

CronMon currently isn't deployed anywhere, but this may change in the future.
